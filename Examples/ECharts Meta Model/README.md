## Purpose

The chart renders a MooD Meta Model using ECharts's [graph with force-directed layout](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=graph-force) which uses a physics based simulator for positioning visual elements.

[![ECharts Force Directed Layout](images/echarts-meta-model.png "ECharts Force Directed Layout")](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=graph-force)

Documentation on configuring an ECharts graph can be found [here](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-graph.layout)
