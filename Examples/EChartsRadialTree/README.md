## Purpose

The tree chart renders the data as a tree in a choice of two layouts: orthogonal or radial.

The orthognal layout renders the data as a dendrogram.

The custom visualization is based on the ECharts Radial Tree example.

## Data Summary

The radial tree visualization consumes multiple data sets: one for each level in the hierarchy. The details of the attributes of the data set is provided in the section Data Details section

1. __rootNode__
    * Details of the node at the root of the tree
1. __level1Relationship__
    * Details of nodes at level 1 of the hierarchy, i.e. nodes whose parent is the root node
1. __level2Relationship__
    * Details of nodes at level 2 of the hierarchy, i.e. nodes whose parent is at level 1
1. __level3Relationship__
    * Details of nodes at level 3 of the hierarchy, i.e. nodes whose parent is at level 2
1. __level4Relationship__
    * Details of nodes at level 4 of the hierarchy, i.e. nodes whose parent is at level 3

## Style

The style of the visualization is controlled by a collection of properties.

__Note:__ Styling via CSS is not possible. ECharts charts are styled via options set in code. This is largely because the preferred implementation for rendering the chart, for browser performance reasons, is on a "canvas" which hides the components from the browser.

### Properties (JSON)

The properties mirror the properties in the __options__ object used to configure the ECharts chart. Further properties can be added be updating the code in this example. See [ECharts Chart Configuration](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#title) for the complete list of available properties.

* __backgroundColor__: defines the background colour of the container for the chart. Supports setting as solid color using rgb(255,255,255), rgba(255,255,255,1), #fff. __Default rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)__
* __series__: styling properties for the chart elements
  * __top__: Distance between tree component and the top side of the container. __Default 18%__
  * __bottom__: Distance between tree component and the bottom side of the container. __Default 14%__
  * __layout__: The layout of the tree, which can be __orthogonal__ or __radial__. The orthogonal layout is horizontal and vertical like a dendrogram. The radial layout refers to the view that the root node as the center and each layer of nodes as a ring. __Default radial__
  * __orient__: The orientation of the tree when the __layout__ is __orthogonal__. Can be one __LR__, __RL__, __TB__ or __BT__. __Default LR__
  * __symbol__: Type of symbol drawn at each node. Can be one of __emptyCircle__, __circle__, __rect__, __roundRect__, __triangle__, __diamond__, __pin__, __arrow__, __none__. __Default emptyCircle__

  * __symbolSize__: Symbol size. It can be set to single numbers like 10, or use an array to represent width and height. For example, [20, 10] means symbol width is 20, and height is 10. __Default 7__
  * __itemStyle__: Defines the style for the chart nodes.
    * __color__: the colour of the node symbol. Supports setting as solid color using rgb(255,255,255), rgba(255,255,255,1), #fff. __Default rgba(180, 180, 180, 0.2)__
  * __label__: Describes the style of the text corresponding to each node.
    * __show__: Defines if the labels are to be shown (true) or not (false). __Default true__
    * __fontSize__: The size of the font for the label. __Default 12__
    * __rotate__: The angle in degrees to rotate the label text. __Default 0__
  * __leafLabel__: Describes the style of the text corresponding to the leaf nodes.
    * __show__: Defines if the labels are to be shown (true) or not (false) on leaf nodes. __Default true__
    * __fontSize__: The size of the font for the label on leaf nodes. __Default 12__
  * __emphasis__: Describes the style of emphasis when the mouse hovers over a node.
    * __focus__: Defines the nodes to highlight (not fade out). __Default relative__. Can be one of
      * __none__ - Do not fade out other data
      * __self__ - Only focus (not fade out) the element of the currently highlighted node
      * __ancestor__ - Focus on all ancestor nodes
      * __descendant__ - Focus on all descendant nodes
      * __relative__ - Focus on all ancestor and descendant nodes

## Inputs

The visualization has one input.

* __maxDepth__: a numeric value that defines Maximum Tree Depth. Changing the value collapses or expands the tree. __Default 2__

## Outputs

The visualization has one output.

* __Node__: the identity of the node that the cursor is hovering over

## Data Details

1. __rootNode__ – one element
    * __Name__: the name of the root element.
1. __level1Relationship__ – one or more relationships
    * __Source__: The source (parent) node
        * __Name__: the name of the parent element.
    * __Target__: The target (child) node
        * __Name__: the name of the child element.
        * __Value__: the value of the child element. This is optional and then only applicable to leaf nodes in the tree hierarchy
1. __level2Relationship__ – zero or more relationships. Same structure as __level1Relationship__
1. __level3Relationship__ – zero or more relationships. Same structure as __level1Relationship__
1. __level4Relationship__ – zero or more relationships. Same structure as __level1Relationship__
