## Purpose

A lollipop chart is a bar chart, where the bar is transformed into a line and a dot. It shows the relationship between a numeric and a categoric variable. The lollipop custom visualization is based on D3 Ordered Lollipop [![D3 Ordered Lollipop](images/lollipop.png "D3 Ordered Lollipop")](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/lollipop_ordered.html)

The categories are drawn on the vertical (y) axis and the values are on the horizontal (x) axis. The lollipop lines are drawn horizontally. The categories on the y axis are ordered by value, with the category with the minimum value appearing at the bottom and the category with the maximum value appearing at the top.

The x-axis range is enlarged in such a way that its minimum and maximum are nicely-rounded values, i.e. multiples of 2, 5 and powers of 10. The chart can be configured to include zero on the x-axis.
