# Purpose
![Process Flow](images/process-flow.png)

The Process Flow visualisation renders a process: a set of activities (steps), with their inputs and outputs, joined into a sequence (flow) by links between them. The elements (activities, inputs and outputs) are automatically positioned on the diagram and the flows (links) between the elements are routed around the elements.

A process can be a collaboration between different organisations (actors) within an enterprise. The collaboration is represented by partitioning the activities into swim-lanes, where each swim-lane corresponds to the organisation performing the activity. The swim-lanes are drawn vertically on the diagram. A swim-lane is drawn on the left for Inputs, and a swim-lane on the right for Outputs.

A process can be partitioned into phases. Each phase is a sequence of activities that achieve a goal within the overall process. Phases are demarked with a vertical label and a horizontal line after the last activity in the phase.

A sub-set of activities within the process, that in combination achieve a goal of note, can be placed in a group. The group is visualised with a labelled rectangle that encloses the activities in the group.

User interaction between the visualisation and the underlying model in MooD is supported. In particular, the user can click on diagram elements to navigate to details of the element. Also the user can click on an element to highlight it and other related elements.

The Process Flow package contains two visualisations:
-   __Process Flow Visualisation__
    -  This renders the process flow. It can be used standalone (using watermarks in the swim-lanes to identify the actore) or in conjunction with __Process Flow Header__
-   __Process Flow Header__
    -  This renders the header of the Process. The visualisation panel is designed to be setup at the top of the page immediately above the __Process Flow Visualisation__. It needs to be configured in Business Architect to be in a fixed position so that it is always visible (doesn't scroll off the page).

## Inputs
The visualisation has a single input (Highlight Node) that defines the primary element(s) to highlight on the diagram.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Outputs
The visualisation has no outputs.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Actions
The visualisation reports the following events. These can be configured to trigger actions in MooD. Defining an action to update the visualisation input results in the highlighting of the element identified by the input.
1.	__Process Step Click__ – a mouse click on a process step node
    *	Identifies the element
1.	__Process I/O Click__ – a mouse click on an input or output node
    *	Identifies the element
1.	__Process Click__ – a mouse click on an external process node in the input or output swim-lane
    *	Identifies the element 
1.	__Phase Click__ – a mouse click on a phase label node 
    *	Identifies the element 
1.	__Actor Click__ – a mouse click on an actor (swim-lane) node
    *	Identifies the element 
1.	__Link Click__ – a mouse click on an flow (link) 
    *	Identifies the relationship 
1.	__I/O Link Click__ – a mouse click on an input or output link
    *	Identifies the relationship 
1.	__Activity Group Click__ – a mouse click on a step (activity) group node 
    *	Identifies the element 
1.	__Non-navigable Node Click__ - a mouse click on any node that is defined to be not navigable, e.g. because there is no model to navigate to. This event is provided to allow such nodes to be highlighted by the custom visualisation by mapping the action to an input action. 
    *	Identifies the element
1.	<a id="test-navigation-event"></a>__Test Navigation__ - This event is only triggered during start up and only if the process is [configured to test node navigation](#test-navigation). If required, this event should be configured with just a Navigate action.
    *	Identifies the element or relationship to test for having a model

# Process Flow Header

## Header Data Summary
The process flow header consumes three data sets. The data sets are identical to the first three data sets consumed by the __Process Flow Visualisation__. The details of the attributes of the data sets is provided in the [Data Details](#data-details) section.

1.	__Process__ – one element
1.	__Actors__ – one or more relationships
1.	__Phases__ – zero or more elements

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Header Style
The style of the header visualisation is controlled by CSS and a collection of properties.

### Header CSS

A Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is defined containing selectors for the following HTML elements in the rendered diagram. The CSS is editable within MooD BA, allowing control of the visual styling of the diagram:
*	Process header
*   Column header text
*	Phase header rectangle
*	Actor-lane header text (for both odd and even lanes)
*	Odd Actor-lane header text
*	Even Actor-lane header text
*	Odd Actor-lane header rectangle
*	Even Actor-lane header rectangle
*	Input / Output lane header rectangle
*	Input / Output lane header text

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Header Properties
The properties are a subset of those in the __Process Flow Visualisation__. They must have the same values as in the __Process Flow Visualistion__ to ensure that the header aligns with the process flow diagram:

*	__gridSize__: The number of pixels between grid points that shapes and lines are aligned (snap) to. __Default__: 10.
*	__processHeaderHeight__: The vertical height, in pixels, allowed for the process header drawn above the diagram: __Default__: 20.
*	__phaseLabelWidth__: The width, in pixels, of the vertical phase label on the left-hand side of the diagram. This is ignored if there are no phases in the process. The value is increased, if necessary, to be a multiple of gridSize. __Default__: 60.
*	__editable__: indicates if the user can edit (re-position) lines and shapes on the diagram. This should be set to false as editing is not currently supported or saved.
*	__inputSwimlaneLabel__: The text for the Inputs swim-lane header. __Defaults__ to "Inputs" if not specified.
*	__outputSwimlaneLabel__: The text for the Outputs swim-lane header. __Defaults__ to "Outputs" if not specified.

## Data Details
1.	__Process__ – one element
    *	__Name__: name of the process. Defaults to the Name property of the element.
    *	__Version__: the version / issue number of the process.
    *   <a id="test-navigation"></a>__Test node navigation__: Indicates if the process flow diagram nodes, e.g. Process Steps, should be checked to see if they have a model to navigate to (true) or not (false). If set to true, the checks are done using the [__Test Navigation__ event](#test-navigation-event) which needs to be configured with just a Navigate action, i.e. no Input action. If checks are performed, the primary events, e.g. __Process Step Click__ and __Process I/O Click__ will only be triggered if the node has a model; if no model the __Non-navigable Node Click__ event is triggered instead. If checks are not performed the primary events are triggered and where there is no model the Navigate action is greyed out (or a warning message is displayed if Navigate is the only action).
1.	__Actors__ – one or more relationships. There are 3 ways of defining the swim-lane background and text colours: on relationship to actor, on actor element, or on an element related to the actor.

    *	__Colour of swim-lane__: colour to use as background for swim-lane. This is optional; if not specified the colour is taken from the colour on the actor element
    *	__Colour of swim-lane watermark text__: colour to use for text in swim-lane watermark. This is optional; if not specified the colour is taken from the colour on the actor element 
    *   __Number of swimlanes for actor__: the number of swimlanes available to layout steps belonging to the actor. This is optional; if not specified it defaults to 1
